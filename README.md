# README for Python Script: Historical Race Data Migration

## Overview

This Python script is designed to retrieve historical race data from an old database and migrate it to a new database. The script converts Excel files containing various race data (location and consumption) into SQL queries for insertion into the new database.

## Functionality

1. **Read Excel Files:**
   - The script reads Excel files that contain the location and consumption data from past races.

2. **Convert Data to SQL Queries:**
   - The script processes the data from the Excel files and generates SQL queries.

3. **Insert Data into New Database:**
   - Then you can execute these SQL queries to insert the data into the new database.

This script facilitates the seamless migration of historical race data, ensuring that all valuable data is preserved and accessible in the new database for further analysis and use.
